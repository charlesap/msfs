A Mutually Suspicious File System

Traditional computing systems delegate the protection of stored data to a trusted, priveleged party
(e.g. the kernel, the supervisor, the administrator, the sysadmin, etc.) This trust is not always warranted.

The Mutually Suspicious File System demonstrates a method by which the user-level process may retain the 
authority and responsibility for access control of stored data on a shared local or remote medium.

A LaTeX type-set paper is drawn from the comments in the Google Go source code via  bash-executable but 
go- and godoc-invisible preamble, unifying the program and the documentation in one text and thereby 
forming a minimally capable literate programming environment.

The system uses FUSE on Linux and OSX and is in the early stages of development.
